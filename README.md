# Automated-Polyhouse-Farming-Tool
Welcome to the README of my project codenamed AgroMate.
It is an IOT based project for the field of Agricultural Polyhouse farming.
The list must contain two .txt files named Arduino Code and Node MCU Code.
The "Arduino Code.txt" is for the Arduino Uno module to control and manage the sensors.
The "Node MCU Code.txt" is for the Node MCU module that is interfaced with the Arduino to act as a Wi-Fi module for the Arduino.
The PPT and Report docx explain the project details in further detail,
The circuit diagram shows the layout of the IOT circuit in detail.
